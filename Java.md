#####OOP concepts
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Encapsulation      | Encapsulation is a technique used for hiding the properties and behaviors of an object and allowing outside access only as appropriate. It prevents other objects from directly altering or accessing the properties or methods of the encapsulated object. |
| Abstraction      | Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations. Showing the functionality but hiding the implementation.      |
| Polymorphism | "one interface, many implementations."      |
